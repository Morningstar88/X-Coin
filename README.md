## Rules for Going Out

- Buy Something First
- Take Someone Charismatic
- Say NOTHING, just give them the "Letter to Shopkeeper" PRINTOUT 
- Strum ukulele, hard 
- Give them 10-15 minutes to respond
- pay them 200, thank them
- Show them the coin

## [Letter to Shopkeeper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10DpnajfbLqazDsTCYXLW8dzyd9WP7qcSgT1uLm0Vi0M/edit)

Dear Shopkeeper,

We would like to pay 2 x credit in your store, 

2 x 100 meals.

Is that possible?

After we pre-pay 200TWD, someone will come with a wooden token that looks like this.

PIC (take with candle and mirror) / Play Ukulele. 

This is for an experimental app. 

Please let us know if you are intrested

Best Wishes,

Morningstar (Foundation)
